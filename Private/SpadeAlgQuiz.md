Here is an initial level of the Spade algorithm for a set of sequences over the GATC alphabet.  

1. Reconstruct the actual set of sequences, including filling in the missing X and Y values on the second and third rows.  (Check this carefully)
2. Use Spade to construct all subsequences beginning with A or C having minsup 3,
showing all generated nodes in the Spade tree for those subsequences.  (There are 6 such subsequences including A and C)

```
A           C            G               T
2,4,6       1            5,7             3
2,5,7       6            1               3, Y
2, X        3, 8         5               1, 4, 7
```
