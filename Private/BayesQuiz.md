The following table of data for Titanic survivors gives age and gender for 5 people,
along with a Y/N value for survival.  Based on this, build a naive Bayesian model
that predicts survival based on age and gender.  (Note this means a pseudocount for M and F
values in both classes and thus denominators of 5 and 4 in the categorical probabilities.)
Compute the likelihood of survival and nonsurvival for a 30 year old male under your model.


age|gender|survived
---|---|---
25|M|N
35|F|Y
5|F|Y
50|M|N
5|M|Y
