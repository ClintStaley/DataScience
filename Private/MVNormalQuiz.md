# Multivariate normal quiz

Name______________________________________________________

1. Draw the surface described by this multivariate normal distribution.  Specifically, draw an axis-numbered X/Y plane, with iso-value curves, to describe the shape of the surface.\
\
$P(X) = \mathcal{N}(X|[2, 3]^T, \begin{bmatrix}.25&&0
\\0&&1\end{bmatrix})$

2. Draw P(X|y=0) as a univariate distribution, showing marks for locations of one standard deviation from the mean.
