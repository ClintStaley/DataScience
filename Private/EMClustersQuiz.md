Two clusters $C_1$ and $C_2$ have centers at (1, 1), and (0, 10), respectively.  Point $x_i$ is at (0,0), yet $w_{2i} > w_{1i}$  Explain two different ways this could be possible despite the distance of $x_i$ from the respective centers.

A cluster has $\mu = \begin{bmatrix}5\\5\end{bmatrix}$ and
 $\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}0.84&&-1.67\\-1.67&&8.66\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}.98&&-0.2\\0.2&&0.98\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0.5&&0\\0&&9\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}.98&&0.2\\-0.2&&0.98\end{bmatrix}$\
 \
 Draw an approximate to-scale picture of the ellipse at one standard deviation distance from the center of this cluster.
