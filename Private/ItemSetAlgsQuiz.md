**1. 12pts** In DeClat, if $d(X_{ab}) = \emptyset$ on line 6, what conclusion
can we reach regarding the respective closures of $X_a$ and $X_{ab}$?  Of
$X_b$ and $X_{ab}$? Justify your conclusion.


**2. 20pts** In FPGrowth, assume $|R| = 5$ in the loop on line 3.

a. 5pts How many times will the loop execute? 



b. 5pts Does $|X| = |P| + |Y|$ on line 4?  If not, how small might $|X|$ be? 
If so, why, since set union doesn't guarantee this??



c. 10pts If the loop executes for $Y = \emptyset$, as would be implied by the $\subseteq$ operation, how is $sup(X)$ on line 5 determined?  If not, then how is P added to $\mathcal{F}$?
