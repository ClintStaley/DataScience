<h2 class="western">Course Instruction</h2>
<h4 class="western">In-Lecture Questions</h4>
<p>I often ask questions in lecture to help you think through the
issues being discussed. For this highly-conceptual class, we'll make
that process a little more formal. Once or twice per lecture I'll ask
a question for you to consider, and to write down answers to. We'll
ask for answers in class, and I'll collect answers on paper. I'll
randomly score one of them every week or so. Each such scored answer
will be worth 1-2% of the final grade.</p>
<h3 class="western">Labs and Project</h3>
<p>We'll have homeworks, and small labs throughout the semester.  
&quot;Labs&quot; will be small coding or computational projects to
explore and reinforce concepts from reading and lecture. They will be
important preparation for the midterms.</p>
<p>Once you have lab experience with various data analysis and
display methods, you'll do a larger project toward the end of the
semester.</p>
<h2 class="western">Midterms</h2>
<p>Class midterms will be partially on-paper tests of concepts and
vocabulary. But at least the first one or two will also include a
practical exercise to complete as a significant part of the test,
generally based on the most recent lab. This is a little
experimental, and depending on its success I may run up to 4 such
midterms, roughly each 3 weeks. The 50 points for midterms will be
divided accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Individual Work Required</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Collaboration on code is strictly
forbidden in this course.&nbsp; Each individual must do his/her own
work on the programming projects, and work only with their partners
in team projects.&nbsp; Violation of this standard results in an
automatic F in the course, plus additional penalties.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I'll hand out in class an agreement to
sign indicating that you understand and will adhere to this policy.&nbsp;
You must get me a signed copy of this agreement by the end of the
first week of class or I will drop you from the course.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Changes to Syllabus</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I reserve the right to make changes to
this published syllabus if it is in the best interest of the
educational development of this class. Any such changes will be
announced as soon as possible and, insofar as practical, after
consultation with the class.</p>
