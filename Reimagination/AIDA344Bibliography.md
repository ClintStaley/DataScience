## Overview
The following are references and tutorials for use in our course.  Most are available online without charge.  (Available online means accessible via a typical university's library online subscription services, e.g. Safari, not necessarily freely available on the web.)

In many courses a Bibliography is an afterthought, but if you are taking this course online or partially-online, it's a central document.  Recorded or in-person lectures will give you the gist of the concepts, and cover the most critical ones.  But online and text material will give you the full details that we can't fit into lecture, and will give you an alternate presentation, which can sometimes be very helpful.

So, *read* the Bibliography list and comments below, read any that are assigned as required reading, and read the others as needed for reference or concept reinforcement.

## Course Texts
These are the course texts. You'll need to get paper or online copies.

**Zaki and Meira, *Data Mining and Machine Learning***
Comprehensive, readable. Highly mathematical, and almost grad-school.  Available online at dataminingbook.info

**Grus, *Data Science from Scratch 2nd Ed***
This is a good complement to Zaki.  It covers practical data science using Python, including setup, data visualization, some tutorials on linear algebra, probability, etc.  Explanations are clear, and offer practical advice (e.g. not to multiply many probabilities but rather add their logs to avoid underflow) 

**O'Neil and Schutt *Doing Data Science*** Practical, clear, approachable style. Realistic.  Current.

## Supplemental Texts
**Mertz, *Cleaning Data for Effective Data Science***  This is an important issue, and not as practically nor thoroughly covered in other texts.  Mertz is literate as a writer, but his explanations tend to ramble through examples without coherent general principles.

[Itemset Algorithm Comparisons](https://www.programmerall.com/article/9818116902/)

Interesting paper comparing APriori, Eclat and FP-Growth algorithm performance

## Tool Documentation

[Main Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)

The main resource for Python documentation, including a tutorial and references. This should be your first stop for Python info as it's the most official

[Main Numpy Docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html)

Numpy is not officially part of the standard Python release, but it may as well be. We'll use it extensively in the course.

[Pandas Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/)

Pandas is almost as common as Numpy in data science Python coding

[Cornell Python for Data Science](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-data-science)

Cornell University provides a set of good online tutorials on a variety of CSCI topics. This is their Python intro and a good alternative to the standard Python docs

[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)

A practical introduction to Python, based on a series of exercises.

[SciPy Tutorials and Reference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)

Keras uses the Python Numpy library for fundamental data types and operations, and we may have assignments that require coding directly in Python using Numpy alone.  The Numpy User Guide on the page given above is a good starting point for learning Numpy.
Many of the non-DL methods we'll explore in Geron use the SciPy library, also
covered at this site.
